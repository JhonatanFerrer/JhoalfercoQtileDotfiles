# JhoalfercoQtileDotfiles

These are my Tokyo-Night based Arch Linux dotfiles, there is still a lot to improve and there are some features I would like to add but for now I think it is good enough :3

Note: I speak Spanish, so I left some things in this language, feel free to change them if you wish. I also recommend to check the autostart.sh file inside the qtile folder, there I define the screens configuration with xrandr.

## Dependencies

- qtile
- kitty
- fastfetch
- picom
- rofi
- gnome polkit
- pipewire
- playerctl
- brightnessctl
- nitrogen
- imagemagick (needed to display images in kitty)
- alsa-utils (amixer is needed for volume widget)
- python libs: iwlib, psutil
- [papirus icons](https://www.pling.com/p/1166289)
- [ubuntu](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.2.1/Ubuntu.zip) and [firacode](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.2.1/FiraCode.zip) nerdfonts (for bar and terminal, respectively)

I also recommend the [Tokyo Night GTK theme](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1681315). You may also find useful this [wallpaper repository](https://github.com/tokyo-night/wallpapers)
